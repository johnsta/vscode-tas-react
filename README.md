# Getting Started

## Getting the Code

Clone directly from GitHub or from your Try Azure App Service instance.

## Running the Application Locally

After cloning, install the necessary npm dependencies and use the `start` npm command to start a local development server.

```
> npm install
> npm start
```

You should now see your application running.

VSCode users can debug their application in Chrome directly from their editor by following these steps:

1.  Run `npm start`, which starts your development server.
2.  Inside VSCode, create a breakpoint and hit F5 to launch Chrome.

## Deploying to Azure

[ Matt to Fill In]

Use `npm run build` to create a production build in the `./dist` folder. Deploy that.
